BlueZ D-Bus Advertisement Monitor API Description [advertisement-monitor-api.txt]
This API allows an client to specify a job of monitoring advertisements by
registering the root of hierarchy and then exposing advertisement monitors
under the root with filtering conditions, thresholds of RSSI and timers
of RSSI thresholds.

Once a monitoring job is activated by BlueZ, the client can expect to get
notified on the targeted advertisements no matter if there is an ongoing
discovery session (a discovery session is started/stopped with methods in
org.bluez.Adapter1 interface).
